        <p><strong>Game Rules:</strong></p>
        <p>1. The board has 22 columns and 38 rows. The left margin (column 0) is a closed wall, while the top, bottom, and right borders are open.</p>
        <p>2. Two players, Mino (Blue) and Chen (Red), take turns placing points on intersections.</p>
        <p>3. A group of enemy points is considered encircled if they are completely enclosed by active points of the opponent.</p>
        <p>4. Only enemy groups that contain at least one enemy point count for scoring.</p>
        <p>5. When an encirclement is detected, the border is drawn by connecting the opponent’s active points along the border.</p>
        <p>6. Encircled points become disabled: although they remain visible, they cannot be used to form new encirclements.</p>
        <p>7. Clicking is only accepted if the mouse is close enough to an intersection center.</p>
